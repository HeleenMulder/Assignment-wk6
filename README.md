In my corpus I want to look at the artist Madonna. This choice may be somewhat influenced by the list of examples provided on Canvas. As Cher has reinvented herself many times so has Madonna; from her early successes from “Like a virgin”, “Material Girl” to and the more computerized music “Vogue” and “Ray of light”. According to Wikipedia she released 92 singles and 24 promotional singles and charted with 12 other songs. She has sold more than 100 million singles worldwide. It is claimed that Madonna is the most successful solo artist in Hot 100 chart history, second overall behind the Beatles.
Also her performances as an actress in Desperately Seeking Susan and the (film)musical “Evita” contributed to the many faces and appereances Madonna has shown throughout the years. 
Each album of Madonna is very specific, one cannot simply say that one album is similar in sound like the other. I want to look and comparise her albums and her songs and see if there are sounds or melodies that are similar to one another that vouche for her succes all over the years. 
Questions like these came to me:
-	Why was “Like a virgin” so succesfull and the song “One more change” was not?
-	What went wrong during her performance at the Eurovision Songfestival? Was is her voice or were there other technical problems?
-	Why is she still that popular in spite of her many different sounds?
